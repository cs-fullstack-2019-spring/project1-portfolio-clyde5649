<article id="me" class="animated rotateIn"><H2>MY ABOUT ME</H2><div><p>HELLO I AM CLYDE BLEDSOE I AM A FUTURE SOFTWARE ENGINEER.
    I WAS BORN IN MEMPHIS TN.I ATTEND WHITE STATION MIDDLE SCHOOL AND WHITE STATION HIGH SCHOOL.TO BE HONEST I DID NOT KNOW IF I WANTED
TO DEAL WITH SOFTWARE UNTILL ONE DAY I MEET A COUPLE AND THEY BOTH DID SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.AND ONCE WE REALLY JUST SAID DOWN
AND HAD A TALK I COULD NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO GET INTO IT.SO ONE DAY AS I WAS ON MY PS3 I JUST SAID
ALL OF THIS IS DEALING WITH SOFTWARE THEN THAT IS HOW I GOT INTO DEALING WITH WEB DEVELOPMENT AND FROM THERE THE CODING TOOK ON.
I WOULD SIT AT THE TABLE AT HOME AND LOOK AT CODE ALL DAY UNTILL I COULD NOT READ ANYMORE.I WANTED TO TEACH MYSELF SOMETHING
THAT I FELT WAS FOR ME AND THAT IS FOR ME. BECAUSE NOTHING IS HARD OR NOT FOR YOU CAN ALWAYS MASTER YOUR GOALS JUST TAKES
TIME AND SO MUCH TIME AND JUST TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING IN LIFE IS EASY..LIFE WILL GIVE YOU TIMES WHEN YOU WILL FALL AND
KEEP FALLING BUT GET UP.BECAUSE IF YOU STAY ON THE GROUND YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT GETTING UP IS AND YOU WILL NOT REACH
YOUE GOAL.ONE OF THE MEN I LOOK UP TO STEVEY HARVEY HE SAID AND I QUOTE "GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE PARACHUTE BUT IT WILL NOT OPEN
    YET.THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LEARN LIFE AND MAKE YOUR GOAL HAPPEN.AND ONCE YOU DO THEN YOU WILL GLIDE.
I FEEL THAT I CAN BE A GOOD FULL STACK DEVELOPER BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE JOB DONE.ITS NOT EASY BUT
ITS NO POINT IN GIVING UP ON ANYTHING YOU WANT I LOVE THE TECH WORLD WEB DESIGN AND NOW BACKEND AND FRONTEND.I KNOW I CAN
BE A GREAT STACK BECAUSE IF I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER I WILL GO TO MY GOOD FRIEND MR.GOOGLE AND FIND THE ANSWER.AND THE PASSION
    IS THERE AND I AM WILLING TO LEARN.</p></div></article>
