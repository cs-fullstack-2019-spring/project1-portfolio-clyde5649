        <H2>CODECREW WEEK ONE</H2>

           <p>Clyde BledsoeI have really enjoy the class so far. We have been learning a lot and I mean a lot.
               I didn’t think we would be moving this fast but we are. I plan to have everything mastered and have
               everything I need to know by the time the class is over. I am please with the class I just have to get the
               wish we could slow down or stick to one subject sometimes.but I understand we have guide lines we have to
               meet in order to be done by the time we need to Learning about console.log and learning about variables
               it was kinda cool. There are parts you my know but if you leave the slightest thing out it can not go
               through. And thays why I like the class because they show you what if and what can happen if you do it
               right or wrong. And they show you how just by missing a : or a ; can show how the computer will not be
               able to read it. Overall I like the class and I plan to be one of the people walking across the stage.
               It has been a not so easy rode so far I plan on it changing shorting then</p>

            <h2>CODECREW WEEK TWO</h2>

            <p>this week was very new to say the least. jumping into new things like switch and and arrays.
            this week showed me alot it showed me how each code adds on to the next one. and it showed me that leaving
            just the smallest thing off your code will not run I understand that no matter what you can never get a code
            to just run right first.It takes time i am still very much ready for this because i see this is not going to
            be very easy but i am ready<p/>




            <h2>CODECREW WEEK THREE</h2>
            <p>Journal entryLast week was a little rough but not to bad python has its ups and downs. It’s not as different
                as java script. Our while loops and our ifs are mostly the same. But now we can add or pop or clear with
                just using words. I feel like the class is going get much better as we learn and understand our work.And
                the new != its something to remember and the true and false table. We are learning. And the indent when
                your typing to put s function in s function</p>






            <h2>CODECREW WEEK FOUR</h2>

            <p>Journal entry Clyde bledsoeThis week was kind of cool we learn new was to use jquiery  and we learn about
                jquiery. So it kinda makes it easier to use without going to your css and putting it in. So basically
                this week was learning the easy way to go about using colors and everything without having to use your
                css. The class has been good I like it learning what we haveit’s been been a challenge for me but if it
                was easy then it wouldn’t be a point of doing it. Life is not easy  so why would coding.</p>



            <h2>CODECREW WEEK FIVE</h2>

            <p>Journey entry February 17Hello last week we took the time to go over our projects. And we took the rest
                of the four days to come up and make our website look like we want it to. So far we have learn so much
                from javascript to python into html and css different ways to code in different programs.Lately to be
                honestI have so much going on with my car and at home and trying to focus that I had lost site of my
                class work. When I get to class I am watching and learning and if it is something I will google it.
                With our class sessions I am mostly at class unless I either have problems with my car or something came
                up because I sign up for this class because I know what I want to be and it is a software engineer.

                   <br>During the time at home when we get out of class I spend 4 hours or till 12 looking at the work. And going over
                it and trying to teach myself.Just  sometimes when you had things going on you just can not focus.I have never
                had anything going on that I couldn’t focus on my work but we have seasons in life that will sometimes
                come in and you have to pray and tell God I will get through with your help.And can you guide me. I am
                and will be a software engineer I just had a season at the beginning of my class and it wasn’t good at
                all. So many things had became wrong and it was like there was nothing right. But God came in and help
                me and I have been doing my project and I can say it looks good to me it my not be the best but it shows
                what I can do at this stage.</p>
